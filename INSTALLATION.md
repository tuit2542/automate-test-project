Hereâ€™s the **Installation** section in Markdown format for your **Robot Framework** project:

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/robot-framework-login-practice.git
cd robot-framework-login-practice
```

### 2. Install Python (if not already installed)

Ensure you have **Python** installed (version 3.7 or later). You can download and install Python from the official site:

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once Python is installed, verify the installation by running:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the Python version displayed (e.g., `Python 3.8.10`).

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project uses **Robot Framework** and other required libraries. Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- **robotframework**: The core Robot Framework library.
- **robotframework-seleniumlibrary**: Selenium support for web automation (if you're testing a web application).
- **Other dependencies** specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

### 4. (Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated. You can create and activate a virtual environment as follows:

- **Create a virtual environment**:
  
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

- **Activate the virtual environment**:

  - On Windows:
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

After activating the virtual environment, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Verify the Installation

Once dependencies are installed, verify that everything is set up by running a simple Robot Framework command:

```bash
robot --version
```

This should display the installed version of Robot Framework.

You're now ready to start running the test cases in this project!
